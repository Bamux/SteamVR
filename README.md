# Steam VR Statistics
Determines all Steam VR only games and the number of players. The required information was obtained from https://steamdb.info (number of daily players) and www.vrlfg.net (appid of all VR games) with Python using the requests and json library. The information is stored in a sqlite database and evaluated with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The database I have created is available to everyone and can be used for all kinds of statistics and forecasts.
